After a lot of motorbikes and hecticness, I was ready to wind down. Cat Ba Island was perfect for this, I always find when you step on an island life slows down. Cat Ba is right next to the famous and touristy Hแบก Long Bay, with the same big limestone rocks in a rich green water. It is a protected island and national park, which makes it very green and less built up.

On the first day, my friend Jan and I took a boat day trip to explore the bay. This went through Lan Ha Bay and also into Hแบก Long Bay slightly.

The bay has small floating fishing islands and we stopped at one which does research on the fish in the day. There were many different types of fish ranging in size.

We then got to get off the boat, kayak and swim to a close by beach.

There is a famous island we pass by called monkey island, that is full of monkeys, check out this one on the beach!

On the next day, we met up with some new people we met on the boat tour. It was time to explore the national park. I rented a motorbike to get there, which was a short 20 minute drive away.

On the way to the hike, we stopped by a cave:

We then reached the starting point of the hike. It is only 1.5km, but very steep and humid so it was a little tiring. But it was totally worth it once we reached the viewpoint.

We ended off the day with a chill time at the beach.
