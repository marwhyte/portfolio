Koh Tao is a small island known for scuba diving. With only 1,382 people on the island, it is very touristy but still has a lot of local food and beautiful beaches.
Being scuba certified, I was very excited to get back to diving! Last time I went was in 2022, so I was due for a refresher.

I practiced various skills like taking off your mask, buoyancy and retrieving a lost regulator. Then it was time for fun dives!

We saw lots of fish, including barracudas. Here I am with some!

We also did a shipwreck dive to see the HTMS Sattakut. It is a warship sunk in 2011.

So much fun! Each time I dive I like it more then the last, having the ocean and its sealife right in front of you is an incredible experience.

After all my dives, it was time to explore the island a little more. I went to Coconut Viewpoint to see the sunset on the island which gives you a good perspective of the size of the island.

I really enjoyed Koh Tao, I could have easily stayed on the island for much longer.
