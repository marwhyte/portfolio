After 34 hours of traveling, I finally arrived at my first destination, Vietnam! I landed in the busy city of Ho Chi Minh City, otherwise known as Saigon. This is in the south of Vietnam and over the next month I will be climbing my way to the north, trying to experience as much as I can!

One thing hit me after walking out of the airport, the humidity and heat. It was around 28°C (82.4°F) at 5am! My first stop was to get breakfast. I took a taxi to the center and got a Banh Mi and coconut coffee, it was so good!

I also saw a couple taking wedding pictures of an antique car at the opera house which was neat.

The next day I headed to the Co Chi tunnels, an eye opening experience of the remenence from the Vietnam War (or American war is it is called by Vietnamese)
