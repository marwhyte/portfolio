Costa Rica was a two-week trip with my older brother. We both were working remotely, and I took the second week off work to enjoy what this tropical paradise had to offer.

We arrived in Tamarindo during the beginning of the rainy season, which honestly was a lot of fun! I joined meetings in all sorts of weather, from sun to intense rain and thunderstorms. One of the coolest things to wake up to was the monkeys on their daily trip from one side of the town to the other. They are a little tricky to see, but here they are:

Being able to go to the beach for a short work break or after work was so nice!

The most memorable part of this trip was definitely the second week, where I completed my scuba diving certification. There were plenty of skills that needed to be practiced underwater, but we were also able to go on fun dives and see incredible sea life. We saw bull sharks, all types of fish, and a giant sting ray you can see in this video:

Here I am next to a bull shark (they are friends ðŸ¦ˆ!)

When leaving Tamarindo back to San JosÃ©, I had the most interesting airport experience to date. When I arrived, there was a small fence where I showed my boarding pass on an email and they let me in. They had chairs next to the runway, and cows were all around in the grass fields by the runway. Everything was very casual, and after a bit of waiting the plane arrived. It was tiny!

While small, I got to the capital safely even through some storms, smooth sailing. ðŸ˜ƒ
