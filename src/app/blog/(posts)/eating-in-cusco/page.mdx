  title: 'Eating in Cusco',
};

Cusco was one of the most charming cities I have been to. Full of history, culture, beautiful architecture, food and a base to amazing adventures. This was my first location of many at a high altitude, so I was here a couple days to aclimate at 3'400m (11,150 feet). This was a great excuse to explore the city and I actually ended up returning here for longer because I liked it so much! On the first day I happened to run into the weekly Sunday parade Cusco has in Plaza de Armas.

One thing that stuck with me was the food here. It was incredible, Peru is known for their cuisine, this post might just be a food blog ðŸ˜‰.

Ceviche (my favorite dish in the world!) with a needed Pisco Sour

Sopa Tres Quinuas - Soup with three different types of Quinoa (Peru grows over 3,000 types of Quinoa!!)

Basic, but this was a really good avocado toast. Peru's avocados are delicious!

Alright that is enough food for now, I'm getting hungry. An incredible trip I did from Cusco was to go hike to Rainbow mountain, otherwise known as Vinicunca to the locals. This was incredible, and the highest altitude I have ever been! It towers at 5'200m (17,060 feet), making the 1 hour hike no easy feat. But totally worth it at the top! It wasn't sunny so it doesn't pop as much, but it was still very cool.

I was up for an extra hike, so me and my guide went an extra stretch to the Red Valley, by far more beautiful.

For anyone looking for food and adventure, I couldn't recommend Cusco more ðŸ˜„.
