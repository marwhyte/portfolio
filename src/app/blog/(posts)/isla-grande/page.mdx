A couple hour drive and boat ride from Rio de Janeiro sits Isla Grande. It is a picturesque island known for its lush landscapes, stunning beaches, and a tranquil atmosphere, making it a popular destination for tourists seeking relaxation and adventure in nature.

From the moment you step off the boat you already know you are going to like it here.

Our hostel was a little walk into the jungle, with a very green and peaceful view.

From here it was relaxing on beaches, short walks and beer for the rest of the day üçª.

The next day we went on a longer hike, leading to Lopes Mendes Beach. You walk through the jungle and see a bunch of wild life like monkeys, birds and insects. When we made it to the beach, it was surprisingly white and soft. It was probably the first time I stepped on sand that felt like snow!
