    title: 'The journey to Hoi An and Danang'

}

It's time to move to the next place! This morning I walk out and the brother of Nhung (the guide from from my last post) is waiting for me. We will be traveling on motorcycle for the day all the way to Hoi An, with several stops on the way.

The beginning of the ride begins with going through the countryside and seeing many rice fields.

This was very peaceful and gave plenty of time to relax and take in the nature. After around 1 hour of driving, we take a stop at a waterfall. Time to take a swim! The water was refreshing and I had it all to myself since it was still early in the day.

After a while of enjoying, Tran and I were back on the road.

The next stop was the Hai Van Pass, known as one of the most beautiful roads to drive in Vietnam with views of mountains and beaches. Soaking in the views was amazing!

One thing is missing though, and that's food! We were getting close to the city of Danang and stopped to get one of my favorite dishes I tried in Vietnam, Mi Quang. It is a noodle dish with many herbs, meats and a turmeric broth. Peanuts and chiles bring this to the next level.

With a full belly, we headed to famous Lady Buddha of Danang. This status is impressive and full of monkeys. üêí

After a long day I was ready to get to my Airbnb in the countryside, close to Hoi An. This accommodation was my favorite stay in Vietnam, surrounded by local people and a stunning country side but only a small bike ride away from the touristy town of Hoi An.

As night time hit, it was time to go see what Hoi An is famous for, it's lantern festival. The whole town wakes up at night up with lights and markets at every corner.

The next morning I went to a tailor in the town, which is famous for it's affordable yet high quality of clothes. I got a suit, two dress shirts and a pair of chino pants made and the process was so fun! The lady inside was very funny and I came back multiple times to make sure everything fit just right.

It was now time to head to the city of Danang, just a short 30 minutes away. It's a beach city that reminded me of Maimi with a Vietnamese charm, this was my favorite city to work in! I could definetly imagine living here most out of all the places I went in Vietnam.

The couple days here were very relaxed, eating food, chilling on the beach and getting work done.
