My adventure to Vietnam starts with a 12 hour layover in Tokyo. When I saw this, I got very excited as I could have plenty of time to leave the airport and explore! My first stop was to the neighborhood of Shibuya, getting to see the famous Shibuya crossing.

When the pedestrian light turns green, everyone begin to hustle in every direction! It is quite a sight to see and I found myself crossing several times to soak in the experience. I explored the streets in Shibuya for a while, especially enjoying the tight streets at every turn.

Next up on my tight schedule was heading to Asakusa, to explore Senso-ji, Tokyoâ€™s oldest temple and its surrounding market streets. I hopped on the metro with my Suica transportation card and was shocked by how on time everything was. Things seemed to just work ðŸ˜². This and how polite everybody was very refreshing to see. I arrived at Asakusa station and a short walk later I was at the popular Senso-ji temple.

After this, I was starting to get hungry and luckily had made a reservation at a sushi restaurant before arriving! I didn't happen to get any photos here, because of the very intimate setting. I was sat with around 7 other Japanese in front of a sushi chef and brought individual bite site sushi. This was one of the best foods I have eaten, each bite with a perfect balance of flavours that melted in your mouth. My favorite was a thick tuna nigiri that was so fatty and delicious.

With a full belly, I had a final walk before heading to the airport. I happened to spot one of the famous cherry blossoms in front of the Tokyo Skytree, which felt like a happy ending to my short visit in Tokyo!

As I headed back to the airport, I knew one thing for sure, I needed to plan a longer trip to explore more of the amazing culture and beauty Japan has to offer ðŸ˜ƒ.
