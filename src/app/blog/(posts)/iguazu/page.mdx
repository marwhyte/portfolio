After a short flight from Buenos Aires to Puerto Iguazu, I was ready to witness the breathtaking Iguazu Falls. This trip was a two-day adventure exploring one of the most stunning natural wonders of the world, located on the border of Argentina and Brazil.

## Day 1

I started my journey by going directly from the airport to the Argentinian Iguazu National Park. When you enter you get on a train which takes you to various viewpoints.

The first stop is the Devil's Throat, where the sheer power and volume of water left me in awe.

The view was mesmerizing, with rainbows forming in the mist created by the falls. I spent a good amount of time here, soaking in the beauty and taking countless photos.

From here, instead of taking the train back I decided to walk through the jungle path to the upper and lower circuits. I really enjoyed the Argentinian side of the falls because there was much more to explore.

The upper circuit is a series of bridges that take you over the falls.

There was wildlife everywhere, including a family of coatis, vultures and plush-crested Jays.

Next up was the lower circuit, which is a series of trails that take you down to the base of the falls.

## Day 2

On the second day, I crossed the border into Brazil and visited the Brazilian side of the falls. This side had much less to explore, but offers a better view of the falls.

The trip concluded with getting much closer to the falls, which was a nice way to end the trip. Iguazu Falls is truly a natural wonder that I would recommend to anyone!
