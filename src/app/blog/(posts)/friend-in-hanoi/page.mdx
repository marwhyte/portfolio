Next stop is Hanoi! I have a flight from Danang to Hanoi, where I have plans to meet a friend I met 10 years ago, Jan. We hadn't seen each other in 5 years so I was looking forward to catching up. But first, when arriving in Hanoi, I had to eat. I decided to get a delicious Bun Cha, famous in Hanoi.

I then met up with my friend, who will be joining me through the rest of my travels in Vietnam and Thailand (spoiler).

We took the rest of the day easy, catching up after a long time seeing each other.

The next day, we started with a coffee famous in Hanoi, Egg Coffee. It is very rich and has a caramel taste.

Jan is a great photographer and got some photos that portray the busy city of Hanoi.

We ended the day off with some beers in front of the Hanoi Cathedral.

The next day, we went to the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, where Ho Chi Minh's body is preserved (against his wishes).

At night we went to get drinks at the famous train street, where you can sit by train tracks and watch the train go by.

This concludes Hanoi, as we head on a sleeper bus to the Ha Giang Loop.
