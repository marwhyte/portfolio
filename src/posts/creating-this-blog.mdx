## Crafting a Blog with Next.js and MDX

Hello everyone! Venturing into the Next.js universe to build my blog turned out to be an enlightening journey. I decided to step away from the traditional pages router and instead, embraced the app router. Here's what I learned along the way.

### Choosing the App Router

Opting for the app router was a conscious decision to tap into the flexible routing system of Next.js. It was a shift from the norm but aligned perfectly with my goal of making a faster and more SEO-friendly blog.

### Unveiling the Magic of Pre-rendering

Pre-rendering with Next.js is a bit like having a superpower. It means your pages are ready to go before your audience even asks for them. But how can you be sure it's actually working?

#### Validating Pre-rendering

To test it out:

1. **Disable JavaScript in your browser:** This simulates how a search engine views your site.
2. **Navigate to your blog:** If everything renders correctly without JavaScript, it's a good sign that Next.js has done its job well.

### Implementing View Count with Redis

Understanding my audience's engagement was key, so I integrated a Redis solution through Upstash. This approach allowed me to track views efficiently without compromising site performance.

### Exploring Dynamic Routes and MDX

The journey continued with implementing dynamic routes. I structured the blog posts within `app/blog/[slug]`. To publish a new piece, simply adding a `.mdx` file to the `app/posts` was all it took.

`<code>app/blog/[slug].js</code>`

The integration of MDX was particularly exciting. It allowed for markdown files interspersed with React components, bringing the posts to life. Coupled with TailwindCSS, the customization possibilities became endless.

### Final Thoughts

Building this blog with Next.js and MDX was a mix of challenges and triumphs. It was more than just codingâ€”it was about making content accessible and engaging. For those pondering over starting their own Next.js blog, my advice is simple: dive in. There's a lot to learn, and it's well worth the journey.

Till next time, happy coding!
